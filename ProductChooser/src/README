PURPOSE

This project performs search of products with their display name.If a matching
display name is found, it returns the product's id and internal name.

FILES

* Folder JSONfiles contains all the necessary JSON files for this project.

* It contains the full JSON files of the 8 franchises (appliances , food etc.)

* ids_* files also contain all the products under the 8 franchises but with only 3
   parameters - displayName, id and name of the products for ease of use.

* id_allProducts.json contains all the products in the consumer database with their
   corresponding 3 parameters.

* id_allProducts.json is a slightly modified version of the file ids_allProducts.json

CODE

* ProductSearch.java is a helper file that concatenetes the data from the 8
  different category files (No need to run this file as I have included the output 
  ie. ids_allProducts.json in the JSONfiles directory)

* GetAllProducts.java is the code that implements the search functionality

* ProductsInfo.java is the object class for the products.
